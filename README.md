# CST-499-Capstone-Project-SP23---LinkIt
LinkIt is a tool that automates the most labor-intensive manual tasks associated with data integration by examining disparate data, rationalizing the schema, and finding natural linkages. LinkIt provides an extensible framework so that the range of data it understands can be expanded over time â€“ perhaps even by non-programmers.
